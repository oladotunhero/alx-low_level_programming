More functions, more nested loops
Requirements

    Language: C
    OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    Compiler: gcc 4.8.4

Synopsis

This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal was to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.
Concepts I gained a deeper understanding of include:

    nested loops and how to use them
    functions and how to use functions
    difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
    a prototype
    scope of variables
    header files and how to to use them with #include

Description of what each file does:

    a function that checks for uppercase character
    a function that checks for a digit 0 - 9
    a function that multiplies two integers
    a function that prints the numbers 0-9
    a function that prints the numbers 0-9 and skips 2 and 4
    a function that prints 10 times the numbers 0-14
    a function that draws a straight line in the terminal, print "_" n times
    a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal, print "\" n times
    a function that prints a square, using #
    a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, "Fizz" for multiples of three, "Buzz" for multiples of five, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers which are multiples of both three and five
    a function that prints a triangle with # based on size argument
